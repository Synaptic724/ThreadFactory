# 🗺️ ThreadFactory Roadmap

## ✅ v1.0 Release (Now)
- Core thread-safe collections:
  - `ConcurrentList`
  - `ConcurrentDict`
  - `ConcurrentBag`
  - `ConcurrentQueue`
  - `ConcurrentStack`
- Parallel utilities:
  - `parallel_for`
  - `parallel_map`
  - `parallel_invoke`
- Python 3.13+ (No-GIL) optimized
- Full unit test coverage
- Benchmark suite against standard library concurrency tools

---

## 🔨 Planned Features (v1.1 - v2.0)

### 🚀 Dynamic Thread Pool / Task Executor (ThreadFactory Workers)
- `ThreadPool` with dynamic worker management
- `.submit()` returns a `Future`
- Task timeouts, retries, and cancellation support
- Pluggable task queue backends (`deque`, work-stealing, etc.)
- No-GIL optimized worker threads
- Graceful shutdown and restart support

---

### ⚙️ Advanced Synchronization
- Reader/Writer locks
- Spinlocks and condition variables
- Async thread-safe hybrids (asyncio + threading)

---

### 📦 Additional Data Structures
- `ConcurrentSet`
- Priority queues (min-heaps / max-heaps)
- Shared-memory data stores (planned for future versions)

---

## 🌐 Long-Term Vision
- **ThreadFactory**: Python’s concurrency **backbone** for Free Threading
- Distributed task execution (multi-node)
- Cooperative parallelism (actor-based models)
- Optional C-extension acceleration for ultra-low latency performance
